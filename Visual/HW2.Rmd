# Checking the dimensions of the dataset
```{r}
dim(mtcars)

```
So we have 31 rows and 11 variables in the data set.

Lets check the names of the variables and the structure of the dataset
```{r}
names(mtcars)
str(mtcars)
class(mtcars$vs)
```
The variables cyl,vs,am,gear and carb are wrongly interpreted as numeric they should be converted to factor variables.
```{r}
mtcars$cyl<-as.factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs<-as.factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$am<-as.factor(mtcars$am)
mtcars$gear<-as.factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb<-as.factor(mtcars$carb)

str(mtcars)
```
